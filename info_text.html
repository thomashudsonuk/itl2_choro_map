<p>This R Shiny app allows you to upload a CSV file containing
data for the International Territorial Level (ITL) 2 areas of the UK and 
create a choropleth map of the data. The CSV file must contain a column 
named 'ITL221NM' which contains the names of the ITL2 areas. The first 
row of the CSV file must contain the column names. The CSV file must be 
less than 1GB in size.</p>

<p>The user can select a column from the CSV file to be used to colour the
ITL2 areas. Only numeric columns are available to be selected. The legend
will be automatically generated based on the data in the selected column;
to avoid an error, this can sometimes result in a less than useful colour
range.</p>

<p>The CSV file will be uploaded to the Shiny server and will not be stored
or shared. The CSV file will be deleted from the Shiny server when the
session ends.</p>
